# Jenkins Freestyle Delivery Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to build a delivery pipeline using **Jenkins Freestyle Jobs** with upstream and downstream triggers.  

---

## ðŸš€ Pipeline Overview
The pipeline consists of 4 stages, implemented as separate Freestyle jobs:

1. **Compile** â€“ Compiles the source code.  
2. **Code Review** â€“ Runs static analysis or linting checks.  
3. **Test** â€“ Executes unit/integration tests.  
4. **Package** â€“ Packages the build artifacts.  

Jobs are connected using **upstream and downstream triggers**, so the pipeline executes in sequence.
